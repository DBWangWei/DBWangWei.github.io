It is an essential procedure in a wide range of applications. Recently, embedding and auto-encoding methods as well as pre-trained models have gained popularity. They basically deal with high-dimensional data, and this trend brings new opportunities and challenges to similarity query processing for high-dimensional data. Meanwhile, new techniques have emerged to tackle this long-standing problem theoretically and empirically. </p> <p>In this tutorial, we summarize existing solutions, especially recent advancements from both database (DB) and machine learning (ML) communities, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We review exact and approximate methods such as cover tree, locality sensitive hashing, product quantization, and proximity graphs. We also discuss the selectivity estimation problem and show how researchers are bringing in state-of-the-art ML techniques to address the problem. By highlighting the strong connections between DB and ML, we hope that this tutorial provides an impetus towards new ML for DB solutions and vice versa.</p>"},{"location":"resources/tutorials/VLDB20-tutorial-simqp-high-dim/#slides","title":"Slides","text":"<p>Slides (updated on 4 Sept 2020):</p> <ol> <li>Introduction</li> <li>Exact Query Processing</li> <li>Approximate-1</li> <li>Approximate-2</li> <li>Approximate-3</li> <li>Estimation</li> <li>Open Problems</li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"teaching/","title":"Current Teaching","text":"<ul> <li>DSAA1001 Module2 25Spring: Introduction to Data Science and Analytics</li> <li>DSAA2043 L01 25Spring: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</li> </ul>","tags":["teaching"]},{"location":"teaching/#past-teaching","title":"Past Teaching","text":"<p>I taught </p> <ul> <li>UFUG2602: Data Structure and Algorithm Design </li> <li>DSAA1001: Introduction to Data Science and Analytics</li> <li>DSAA2043: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</li> <li>DSAA5002: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery in Data Science</li> <li>DSAA5012: Advanced Database Management for Data Science</li> <li>DSAA6000A: Topics in Similarity Query Processing</li> <li>DSAA6000F: Topics in Advanced Databases</li> </ul> <p>I was the LiC of the following courses at UNSW:</p> <ul> <li>COMP3311: Database Systems</li> <li>COMP9318: Data Warehousing and Data Mining</li> <li>COMP6714: Information Retrieval and Web Search</li> </ul>","tags":["teaching"]}]}
