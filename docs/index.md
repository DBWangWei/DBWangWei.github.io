# Research

My research areas include **Databases**, **Algorithms**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cross-disciplinary Topics**. I have published research papers in these areas, with a majority of them in prestigious international journal and conferences. 

I have won several awards, including **SIGSPATIAL Best Vision Paper**, **ICASSP 2023 Top 3% Paper**, **SIGCOMM 2022 Best Paper**, **ICMR 2021 Best Paper** and **DASFAA 2016 Best Student Paper** awards. In addition, several pieces of my research have been deployed in industrial projects and products. 


My current research interests are: 

* <mark>Integration of database and artificial intelligence technologies</mark>, including learned indexes, learned algorithms and optimizations, and intelligent data preprocess and postprocessing (e.g., data cleansing/integration and NLP interface for DB/applications). 
* <mark>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</mark>, including <mark>Large Language Models</mark>, <mark>Natural Language Processing</mark>, <mark>Knowledge graphs</mark>, <mark>Security issues of deep learning models</mark> (e.g, adversarial attacks and defense).
* <mark>Understanding high-dimensional data</mark>, including its structure, properties, and algorithms (e.g., vector databases). 
* <mark>Cross-disciplinary research and applications</mark>, including <mark>Material Informatics</mark> (e.g., material property prediction, material design, physics-informed neural networks, sybmolic regression, etc.) and <mark>Electronic Design Automation</mark>.

# Teaching

- I am the **Computer Science Coordinator** of HKUST(GZ), in charge of all Computer Science-related courses in the first two years for UG students. 
- I am also overseeing teaching related issues (including teaching innovation and teaching quality) in the DSA thrust, HKUST(GZ). 
- Currently, we are building AI4Edu systems based on Large Language Models, with the aim to explore new learning paradigms. 

# Service

I am an Associate Editor of IEEE TKDE, Journal of Material Informatics, and Data Science and Engineering. I also served as PC Co-chairs of [IEEE BigData 2023](http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2023/) and APWeb 2012, PC Vice-chairs of ICDE 2014 and 2018. I also served in other organizational roles in many conferences and workshops, as well as reviewers and PC members for major journals and conferences.  

I am the Vice Directors of Guangzhou Municipal Key Laboratory of Materials Informatics, Guangzhou Municipal Key Laboratory of Electronic Design Automation, Guangzhou Municipal Key Laboratory of Big Data and Intelligence. I am the Council Member of Guangzhou Intelligent Networking and New Energy Automobile Industry Talent Federation.
